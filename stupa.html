    <h1>Dhamek Stupa</h1>
    <p>Dhamek Stupa (also spelled Dhamekh and Dhamekha) is a massive stupa located at the archaeological site of Sarnath in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. Dhamek Stupa marks the precise location where the Buddha preached his first discourse to his first five disciples (Kaundinya, Assaji, Bhaddiya, Vappa and Mahanama), and where all five eventually became fully liberated.
        Dhamek Stupa is located 180 metres (590 feet) to the east of Dharmarajika Stupa at the archaeological site of Sarnath. Sarnath is located 12 kilometres (7.5 miles) to the northeast of Varanasi, in Uttar Pradesh, India.
        After the parinirvana of the Buddha in 544 BCE, his remains were cremated and the ashes were divided and buried under eight stupas, with two further stupas encasing the urn and the embers. Dhamek Stupa was presumably among these eight stupas. In 249 BCE, Mauryan King Ashoka commissioned the expansion of Dhamek Stupa. Dhamek Stupa was further expanded in 500 CE.

        A 17th-century Jain manuscript describes a Jain temple in Varanasi as a pilgrimage site for Jains. The temple is located close to "a famous Bodisattva sanctuary" at a place called dharmeksƒÅ.
