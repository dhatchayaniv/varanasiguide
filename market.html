        The favorite stop of shopaholics visiting Varanasi is the bustling lanes of Godowlia Market. Stretching at a distance of about 3 km, this market is present in the vicinity of Shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple and is one of the oldest local bazaars of the city. With old buildings forming the boundaries of its lanes, the narrow street is lined with shops and stalls of local vendors selling all kinds of commodities. Frequented by locals who visit the market to purchase groceries, hardware, and household items, this market is famous for its silk embroidery.
