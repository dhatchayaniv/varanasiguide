    <h1>Alamgir Fort</h1>
    <p>The Alamgir Mosque, Varanasi, Aurangzeb's Mosque, is situated in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.The mosque is located at a prominent site above the Panchaganga Ghat. The ghat has broad steps that go down to the Ganges.

        Aurangzeb captured Varanasi in 1669 and destroyed the ancient Bindu Madhav temple and built a mosque on the ruins of the temple in 1673 and named it as Alamagir Mosque in the name of his own honorific title "Alamgir", which he had adopted after becoming the emperor of the Mughal empire.        
        The minarets couldn't withstand the test of time and in the 19th century, an English scholar James Prinsep had to restore them. In 1948 one of the minarets collapsed killing a few people around the time of the floods. Later the government pulled down the other minaret due to security reasons.</p>
