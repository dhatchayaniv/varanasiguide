    <h1>Man Mandir</h1>
    <p>Man Mandir Ghat is as aesthetic as it is enormous. Situated north to the Dashashwamedh Ghat, it is also known as Someswara Ghat, after the lingam of Lord Someshwar (another form of Lord Shiva) which is found here. The ghat was built by Maharaja Man Singh of Amer in 1600 AD, along with a magnificent palace located in close proximity. The palace is a major tourist attraction in itself with its ornate window carvings and other splendid features. There is an observatory on the roof of the palace called Jantar Mantar which was built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II in 1710 AD. If you head over to the northern part of the balcony with its stone balconies, you will be treated to some fabulous views of the surroundings.</p>
